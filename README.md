### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zack Sargent. 

I love programming, and I am very strongly interested in hacking and cybersecurity.

I also have a strong history in web development.

## Notable Projects:

> **[Wiki Races](https://github.com/ElderINTERalliance/WikiRaces2021)**
> is a website I developed for an online tech conference called [TechOlympics](https://techolympics.org/). 
> The goal of Wiki Races is to start on a Wikipedia page and get to another Wikipedia page as fast as possible.
> This project features an ExpressJS website that dynamically generates and cleans up Wikipedia pages for the players
> to click through, as well as a MongoDB backend that keeps track of the user's times.

> **[ElderPass](https://github.com/ElderINTERalliance/ElderPass)** is a full stack web application 
> I made for my high school to track student activity during a period of free time built into the schedule.
> The idea is for students to have badges with QR codes that the teachers can use to scan them in and out of classes and clubs.
> This project features an ExpressJS backend, authenticated with Auth0, which stores all the data in Google Sheets (as requested by
> my school's data admins).

> **[BOSS](https://github.com/ElderINTERalliance/boss)**, or Better Online School Setup,
> is an [award winning](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/20-oh01) Electron app that aims to alleviate issues with online schooling.
