### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zack Sargent. 

I work most heavily with Javascript and Front-end development, but I mess around in other tech stacks as well.

I am a junior in high school.

## Notable Projects:

> **[Wiki Races](https://github.com/ElderINTERalliance/WikiRaces2021)**
> is a website I developed for an online tech conference called [TechOlympics](https://techolympics.org/). 
> The goal of Wiki Races is to start on a Wikipedia page and get to another Wikipedia page as fast as possible.
> This project features an ExpressJS website that dynamically generates and cleans up Wikipedia pages for the players
> to click through, as well as a MongoDB backend that keeps track of the user's times.
> 
> This app is not completed, but it meets the requirements of a Minimum Viable Product, to use Agile terminology. 

> **[BOSS](https://github.com/ElderINTERalliance/boss)**, or Better Online School Setup,
> is an [award winning](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/20-oh01) Electron app that aims to alleviate issues with online schooling.

> **[Project Euler](https://github.com/zsarge/ProjectEuler)** is a collection of algorithms that solve discrete
> mathematics problems from the website [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).
> Languages used include Ruby, Python, and Haskell.
